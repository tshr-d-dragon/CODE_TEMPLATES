# CODE_TEMPLATES

### This repository contains various code templates that can be reused for diffrent projects activities like:
1. Regression, Classification with various algorithms along with pre-processing like treatment of missing values, different tranformation, up/down sampling, Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, etc.
2. ANN(Artificial Neural Network) along with  Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
3. CNN(Convolutinal Neural Network)  along with  Hyperparameter tuning using Keras tuner

#### Many more templates will be added in future and please feel free to add
