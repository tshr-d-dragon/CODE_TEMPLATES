# CODE_TEMPLATES

### This repository contains various code templates that can be reused for diffrent projects activities like:
1. Regression, Classification with various algorithms along with pre-processing like treatment of missing values, different tranformation, up/down sampling, Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, etc.
2. ANN(Artificial Neural Network) along with  Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
3. CNN(Convolutinal Neural Network)  along with  Hyperparameter tuning using Keras tuner
4. Using pandas.DateTime, collect various data just from a date value 

#### Many more templates will be added in future and please feel free to add
